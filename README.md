# Discover Cincinnati

This website was designed and built as the final capstone project of a team of 3 students graduating from Kable Academy's summer web development bootcamp program.

## Getting Started

Before you can run any scripts, you will first need Node Package Manager installed, then you will need to run `npm i` in the project root directory to install necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

Once the above is complete, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See Meta's section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
